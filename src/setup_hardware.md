# Hardware setup

## Bluepill board
The blue pill board is an inexpensive stm32f103 based microcontroller board that is available from many resellers. It is inexpensive and relatively powerful so it's
perfect for learning. The stm32f103 comes with plenty of I/O, decent amounts of flash and RAM memory and is quite fast.

## STLink v2 or equivalent
The STLink v2 is a USB programmer and debugger for the stm32 range of microcontrollers by STMicroelectronics. The STLink itself is not expensive but even cheaper
imitations can be bought that will also do the job.

## Connect your hardware
