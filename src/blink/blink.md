# Blink a led
In this chapter we will walk through a simle but complete project from start to finish. We will first set up a Rust project to target the stm32 on the bluepill board. We will create a simple program to blink a led. Then we will demonstrate how to build the code and program the board and we will show how to run the program in a debugger.
